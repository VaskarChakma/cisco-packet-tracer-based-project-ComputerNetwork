# Network Configuration and Routing Experiments

This repository contains the configurations and experiments related to switches, VLANs, and routing. It includes the following topics:

- **Switch Configuration**: Basic and advanced switch configurations for network setup.
- **VLAN Configuration Experiment**: Configurations related to Virtual LANs, including VLAN creation, assignment, and testing.
- **One-Handed Routing Experiment**: An experiment involving routing protocols and configuration for routing a network with limited resources (one-handed setup).

## Repository Contents

- **switch_configuration**: Contains files and scripts for basic and advanced switch configurations.
- **vlan_configuration**: Includes configuration files for setting up and testing VLANs.
- **one_hand_routing**: Contains configurations and setup for routing experiments with constrained resources.

## Prerequisites

- A basic understanding of networking concepts such as VLANs, switches, and routing.
- A network simulator or real networking equipment to test the configurations (e.g., Cisco Packet Tracer, GNS3, or real devices).
- Access to the relevant tools for experimenting with the configurations.
